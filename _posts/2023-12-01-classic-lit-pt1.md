# Introduction
I am a university student, and, contrary to what many around me seem to believe, university is, in fact, for the purpose of studying dusty old books. It may seem ironic for a statistics student to be making that claim, but getting a B.S. does not exclude me from knowing the true purpose of university study, nor does it stop me from achieving that purpose. Being well-read is an excellent goal for anyone and one which typically requires them to read a large amount of "great" fiction. 

The stories that shaped the world into what it is today are worth our time. But how many people's time is it worth? And where in the world are these great stories coming from? Let's take a look at just how bestselling these great works are and if there is any particular region where the best books are from.


# Data Collection

## Phase 1: 

## Phase 2: Sources

## Phase 3: Scripts

# Data Cleaning and Prep
Text data is not fun to clean. Believe or not, the titles of books are not consistent between all people that are interested in books. Some know and include subtitles, others do not. Some will remember the phrase "The Adventures of" in a book title, others will append it unnecessarily. Books written in other languages can have different English transliterations. Did you know that the full, origianl title of the novel commonly refered to as *Robinson Crusoe* by Daniel Defoe is actually *The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, of York, Mariner: Who lived Eight and Twenty Years, all alone in an un-inhabited Island on the Coast of America, near the Mouth of the Great River of Oroonoque; Having been cast on Shore by Shipwreck, wherein all the Men perished but himself. With An Account how he was at last as strangely deliver'd by Pyrates. Written by Himself.*? You will find different lengths of this title particular across the internet. 

All this is to say that cleaning these data so that the dataframes can merge on "Title" took longer than expected, and it required a lot of individual cases to make it work right.



# Ethical Considerations
Before scraping, I checked the robots.txt files. In addition, since I was scraping from the html, there was no worry of making mulitple requests that might slow the sites down for other users. I see no reason as to why bestselling data and the library rank data should not be readily available in the same dataset. Likewise, since the country a book can be attributed to be from should ideally be known by the average reader, I see no issue with this data being found along with the rest in a single dataset.
