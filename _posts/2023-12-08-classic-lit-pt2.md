## Introduction
Welcome to part 2 of our exploration through classic fiction of the world! In our [previous post](https://jbfish00.github.io/statsofplato.github.io/2023/12/07/classic-lit-pt1.html), we breifly discussed why one might want to look at data on classic literature. You'll remember that we scraped data from the [OCLC Library 100 List](https://www.oclc.org/en/worldcat/library100/top500.html) and the [List of best-selling books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_books) Wikipedia page then cleane and combined that data with data provided by Shane Sherman of [https://thegreatestbooks.org/](https://thegreatestbooks.org/). 

In this post, we will explore that data visually to see if we can answer questions such as:

-Where are the most popular books in the world from?
-When were these books written?
-Who are the most prolific authors of the books that are considered classics?
