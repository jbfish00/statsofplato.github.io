The title of this blog begins with the word "stats". Thus, statistics and data science are the focus, but you may notice that the title ends with "Plato". The author of this blog is a student of both Plato and Aristotle, thus this blog will be sprinkled with goodness, truth, and beauty so that both the mind and soul of the reader are enriched.
